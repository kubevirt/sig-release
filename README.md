# KubeVirt SIG Release

KubeVirt SIG release is responsible for scheduling and release KubeVirt.

KubeVirt releases 3 times per year, approximately 8-10 weeks after Kubernetes.

## KubeVirt roadmap

See what's coming in our next release, the features that the KubeVirt community is discussing and prioritising for upcoming releases, and track the lifecycle of features across releases.

The [KubeVirt roadmap](ROADMAP.md) includes links to our Virtualization Enhancements Proposals (VEPs) tracking board and our pre-release notes for our upcoming releases.

## KubeVirt support matrix

Use the [KubeVirt to Kubernetes version support matrix](https://github.com/kubevirt/sig-release/blob/main/releases/k8s-support-matrix.md) to verify the version of KubeVirt that are built and supported for your verstion of Kubernetes.
